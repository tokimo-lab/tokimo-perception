//! Cooperative cancellation of in-flight ONNX Runtime inference.
//!
//! Problem: `Session::run_async(..)` spawns the actual ORT call on an internal
//! blocking thread. Dropping the returned future does **not** stop ORT — the
//! thread keeps running to completion, which is why cancelled AI jobs used to
//! leave the worker process pinned at 100% CPU.
//!
//! Solution: ORT exposes `RunOptions::terminate()` which sets a cooperative
//! cancellation flag; the running inference observes it at the next safe point
//! and returns early with "Exiting due to terminate flag". We combine that with
//! a task-local `CANCEL_ID` so that intermediate layers (OcrManager, backends,
//! CLIP/Face services) don't need to thread a `cancel_id` parameter through
//! their signatures — only the AiService public API does.
//!
//! Flow:
//!   1. `AiService::ocr(img, model, cancel_id)` wraps its body in
//!      [`with_cancel_id`], which sets the task-local.
//!   2. The actual inference site creates `Arc<RunOptions>` and calls
//!      [`register_current`] before `run_async`. If a cancel_id is set, the
//!      `Arc` is stashed in the global registry keyed by that id.
//!   3. When the server decides to cancel a job, it calls
//!      [`cancel_inflight`] (via the worker `/v1/cancel` RPC); we look up the
//!      entry and call `terminate()` on every registered RunOptions.
//!   4. The inference future returns an error; `register_current`'s guard is
//!      dropped, removing the weak ref from the registry.
//!
//! Concurrency: multiple `run_async` calls may share the same `cancel_id`
//! (e.g. OCR detect + recognize for the same photo). The registry stores a
//! `Vec<Weak<RunOptions>>` per id; `cancel_inflight` terminates all of them.
